    <!-- Intro to Topic -->
    <h3 class="mar">Colour Blindness:</h3>
    <p class="mar">There are five main types of ways humans can see color. Colour blinesses happen when there are cones in your eveys that shifted and/or are missing. The five main types are as follows:</p>
    <ul class="mar">
      <span class="special-word">
      <li>Trichromatic</li>
      <li>Achromatic</li>
      <li>Protan</li>
      <li>Deuteran</li>
      <li>Tritan</li>
      </span>
    </ul>

    <!-- anomily or anopia? -->
    <h3 class="mar">"omily" or "opia" Suffix?</h3>
    <p class="mar">Before we get into the different types of colour blindness, you'll have to learn what the different suffixes mean. The "anopia" suffix, in relation to color blindness, means its a more sever verson of the disability than its "anomily" counterpart. The colour blindnesses with the "omily" sufix describes when there are less of a certain type of cone but all three types still exist. The "opia" suffex is added on when you are missing a certain type of cone and another type has shifted slightly.
    </p>
    <p class="mar">Now to get into the different types of colour blindnesses! (to see how different color blindesses look scroll down to the bottom)</p>
    
    <!-- Trichromic -->
    <h3 class="mar">Trichromacy:</h3>
    <p class="mar">
      The majority of the population has all three cones and sees all the colours on the visable spectrum. This is called Tricromacy. If you are trichromatic, you are most likely will have no issues differentiating between colours.
    </p>

    <!-- Achromatic -->
    <h3 class="mar">Achromacy:</h3>
    <p class="mar">
      Also known as <span class="special-word">monochromacy</span> this is the type of colour blindeness everyone thinks of when they hear about it. I'm sure you can guess how I'm about to describe it. It's essentially just seeing in grayscale. People with this type of colour blindness see in shades rather than colour. The "a" prefix means without or lacking something, and in this context, it means you don't see colour our are lacking in this ability. This type of colour blindess affects less than 1 in 100,000 people, meaning around 79,000 people are monochromatic. The different variations of this are <span class="special-word">achromatopsia</span> and <span class="special-word">achromatomaly</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="mar">A much more severe version of this would be if you only see in black and white, no grey at all. This condition is called rod monochromacy or total achromacy and is not very well researched. Or in the very least, I couldn't find much information about it online.</p>

    <!-- Protan -->
    <h3 class="mar">Protan:</h3>
    <p class="mar">
      <span class="special-word">Protan</span> colour blindnesses are classified as red-green colour blindness. People with <span class="special-word">protanomaly</span> are deficient in <span class="special-word">red</span> cones and people with <span class="special-word">protanopia</span> lack <span class="special-word">red</span> cones all together. 1.3% of males and 0.3% of females have <span class="special-word">protanopia</span>, and 1.01% of males and 0.02% of females have <span class="special-word">protanomoly</span>.
    </p>

    <!-- Deuteran -->
    <h3 class="mar">Deuteran:</h3>
    <p class="mar">
      Similar to <span class="special-word">protan</span>, <span class="special-word">deuteran</span> colour blindensses affect the red-green cones. Unlike protan, deuteran is the absence or lack of <span class="special-word">green</span> cones. Deteran is the most common form of colour blindness/deficiancy with 4.63% of males and 0.36% of females carrying the genes for deteranomoly as well as 1.27% of males and 0.01% of females having deuteranopia.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Tritan -->
    <h3 class="mar">Tritan</h3>
    <p class="mar">
      <span class="special-word">Tritan</span> colour blindness is <span class="special-word">vastly different</span> from protan and deuteran. It's a blue-yellow colour blindness and the most rare of those three. This type of colour blindness that it only affects 1 in 10,000 people (around 790,000 people).
