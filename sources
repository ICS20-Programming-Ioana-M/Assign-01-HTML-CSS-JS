Most of the info I knew from previous research i did out of curiousity so I don't have the sources but for research I did durring the building of this website, I listed them below.

Also, I did do all the research for the colour perception page in my free time months ago, so all of it is from off the top of head from my previous research which is why there are no sources relating to that page.
